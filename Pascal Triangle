Intuition:

The given code is generating Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows. Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first and last elements of each row are always 1.

Approach:

1. Create a 2D vector r to store the Pascal's triangle.
2. Resize each row of r according to the row number.
3. Initialize the first and last elements of each row as 1.
4. For the elements in between (excluding the first and last), calculate their values by adding the corresponding elements from the previous row.
5. Return the resulting Pascal's triangle.


Complexity:

The time complexity of this code is O(numRows^2) because we need to fill each element of the triangle.
The space complexity is O(numRows^2) because we are storing all the elements of the triangle in the r vector.


class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
        vector<vector<int>> r(numRows);
        for(int i=0;i<numRows;i++){
            r[i].resize(i + 1);
            r[i][0]=1;
            r[i][i]=1;
            for(int j=1;j<i;j++){
                r[i][j]=r[i-1][j-1]+r[i-1][j];
            }
        }
        return r;
    }
};
